    "section": "",
    "text": "Nebraska fans have been blessed with years of being a successful volleyball team. Being one of the most decorated volleyball programs in the country, the Huskers have gone on to win five national titles and have finished as runner-up five different times as well. Their first championship was under Terry Pettit, the Huskers’ second-ever head coach. Then, there came John Cook, who has been with the Big Red now for 23 years.\nThe last time that Nebraska won a title was in their 2017-2018 season, with key players such as Kelly Hunter, Briana Holman and Mikaela Foecke. Their roster consisted of four seniors, four juniors, one sophomore, and six freshmen. In their starting lineup this season, it consists of no seniors, five juniors, four sophomores, and five freshmen. They’ve got a young squad, and several of these freshmen, such as Andi Jackson, Bergen Reilly, and Harper Murray are regular starters who have been making a huge impact on the team.\nBeing six years since the Huskers have won a national title, Nebraska fans are on edge to see if this season could be the season for that. With a win against formerly No.1 Wisconsin, bringing them to the top, the Big Red have remained undefeated so far. My goal is to look into if Nebraska this season is competing at the same level, if not better, as the 2017-2018 national championship-winning squad, and compare how these young, fresh Husker players this season are comparing to seniors from 2017.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggbeeswarm)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(ggbump)\n\nassists2017 &lt;- read_csv('totalassists2017.csv')\n\nassistsclean2017 &lt;- assists2017 |&gt;\n  separate(Player, into=c(\"Player\", \"School\"), sep=\",\") |&gt;\n  mutate(School = gsub(\"(FL)\", \"FL\", School, fixed=TRUE)) |&gt;\n  mutate(School = gsub(\"(NY)\", \"NY\", School, fixed=TRUE)) |&gt;\n  mutate(School = gsub(\"(PA)\", \"PA\", School, fixed=TRUE)) |&gt;\n  separate(School, into=c(\"School\", \"Conference\"), sep=\"\\\\(\") |&gt; \n  mutate(Conference=gsub(\")\", \"\", Conference))\n\nassistsperset2017 &lt;- assistsclean2017 |&gt;\n  mutate(AssistsPerSet = Assists/S)\n\nkh &lt;- assistsperset2017 |&gt;\n  filter(Player == \"Kelly Hunter\")\n\nassists2023 &lt;- read_csv('totalassists2023.csv')\n\n assistsclean2023 &lt;- assists2023 |&gt;\n  separate(Player, into=c(\"Player\", \"School\"), sep=\",\") |&gt;\n  mutate(School = gsub(\"(FL)\", \"FL\", School, fixed=TRUE)) |&gt;\n  mutate(School = gsub(\"(NY)\", \"NY\", School, fixed=TRUE)) |&gt;\n  mutate(School = gsub(\"(PA)\", \"PA\", School, fixed=TRUE)) |&gt;\n  separate(School, into=c(\"School\", \"Conference\"), sep=\"\\\\(\") |&gt; \n  mutate(Conference=gsub(\")\", \"\", Conference))\n\nassistsperset2023 &lt;- assistsclean2023 |&gt;\n  mutate(AssistsPerSet = Assists/S)\n\nbr &lt;- assistsperset2023 |&gt;\n  filter(Player == \"Bergen Reilly\")\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_point(data=assistsperset2017, aes(x=S, y=AssistsPerSet), color=\"dark grey\") +\n geom_point(data=assistsperset2023, aes(x=S, y=AssistsPerSet), color=\"light grey\") +\n  geom_point(data=br, aes(x=S, y=AssistsPerSet), color=\"red\") +\n  geom_point(data=kh, aes(x=S, y=AssistsPerSet), color=\"maroon\") +\n   geom_text(data=br, aes(x=S-.09, y=AssistsPerSet-1, label=Player)) + \n  geom_text(data=kh, aes(x=S-.9, y=AssistsPerSet-1, label=Player)) +\ngeom_encircle(data=br, aes(x=S-.9, y=AssistsPerSet-0), s_shape=.1, expand=-.04, colour=\"red\") + \n  geom_encircle(data=kh,  aes(x=S-.3, y=AssistsPerSet-0), s_shape=.1, expand=-.05, colour=\"maroon\") + \nlabs(x=\"Sets\", y=\"Assists per set\", title=\"Is freshman Bergen Reilly keeping pace with a national championship winning setter?\", subtitle=\"During the 2017-18 championship winning Husker volleyball era, setter Kelly Hunter was a senior. \nNow, freshman Bergen Reilly is keeping up with her pace at that time when it comes to assists per set.\",  caption=\"Source: NCAA | By Faith Worden\") +\n  theme_minimal () +\n  theme(\n  plot.title = element_text(size = 10, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 7.5), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=8.5), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n)\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat’s it with this new Nebraska setter? Bergen Reilly is a freshman and is already making her way to the top. The South Dakota native joined the squad as the starting setter. From this encircling plot, I chose to show off Bergen Reilly compared to the former 2017 Husker setter and three-time Husker All-American Kelly Hunter, who is now one of the assistant coaches. Bergen Reilly is already keeping pace with a then-senior, two-time national championship-winning setter. She’s still racking up sets because the season isn’t quite up yet. But, when it comes to assists per set, Reilly is slightly behind, but overall in the same wheelhouse as Hunter, keeping at the same pace.\n\n\nCode\nhitting2017 &lt;- read_csv('hittingpct2017.csv')\n\nhittingpct2017 &lt;- hitting2017 |&gt;\n  separate(Player, into=c(\"Player\", \"School\"), sep=\",\") |&gt;\n  mutate(School = gsub(\"(FL)\", \"FL\", School, fixed=TRUE)) |&gt;\n  mutate(School = gsub(\"(NY)\", \"NY\", School, fixed=TRUE)) |&gt;\n  mutate(School = gsub(\"(PA)\", \"PA\", School, fixed=TRUE)) |&gt;\n  mutate(School = gsub(\"(OH)\", \"OH\", School, fixed=TRUE)) |&gt;\n  mutate(School = gsub(\"(CA)\", \"CA\", School, fixed=TRUE)) |&gt;\n  separate(School, into=c(\"School\", \"Conference\"), sep=\"\\\\(\") |&gt; \n  mutate(Conference=gsub(\")\", \"\", Conference))\n\nbh &lt;- hittingpct2017 |&gt;\n  filter(Player == \"Briana Holman\")\n\nhitting2023 &lt;- read_csv('hittingpct2023.csv')\n\nhittingpct2023 &lt;- hitting2023 |&gt;\n  separate(Player, into=c(\"Player\", \"School\"), sep=\",\") |&gt;\n  mutate(School = gsub(\"(FL)\", \"FL\", School, fixed=TRUE)) |&gt;\n  mutate(School = gsub(\"(NY)\", \"NY\", School, fixed=TRUE)) |&gt;\n  mutate(School = gsub(\"(PA)\", \"PA\", School, fixed=TRUE)) |&gt;\n  mutate(School = gsub(\"(CA)\", \"CA\", School, fixed=TRUE)) |&gt;\n  separate(School, into=c(\"School\", \"Conference\"), sep=\"\\\\(\") |&gt; \n  mutate(Conference=gsub(\")\", \"\", Conference))\n\naj &lt;- hittingpct2023 |&gt;\n  filter(Player == \"Andi Jackson\")\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_beeswarm(\n    data=hittingpct2023, \n    aes(x=`Pct.`, y=`Pos`), color=\"light grey\") + \n  geom_beeswarm(\n    data=hittingpct2017, \n    aes(x=`Pct.`, y=`Pos`), color=\"dark grey\") + \n   geom_beeswarm(\n    data=aj, \n    aes(x=`Pct.`, y=`Pos`), color=\"red\") + \n    geom_beeswarm(\n    data=bh, \n    aes(x=`Pct.`, y=`Pos`), color=\"maroon\") +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=bh, \n    aes(x=`Pct.`, y=`Pos`, label=Player)) +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=aj, \n    aes(x=`Pct.`, y=`Pos`, label=Player)) +\nlabs(x=\"Hitting Pct.\", y=\"Position\", title=\"Andi Jackson swings her way ahead of the rest\", subtitle=\"Freshman Andi Jackson, setter for NU, ranks at No.25 for hitting percentage this season.

The freshman middle blocker from Colorado has had a season-high of 13 kills in a game versus Michigan State and has consistently been a key player when it comes to blocking and kills. Now, let’s compare Jackson to Briana Holman, who in 2017 was a senior middle blocker for Nebraska. Holman had several accomplishments, such as being named with AVCA All-America and All-Big Ten honorable mention, being named as Big Ten Defensive Player of the Week, and much more. Holman was a strong force for Nebraska. Now, looking at this beeswarm plot, it shows Andi Jackson compared to Briana Holman in their respective seasons for hitting percentage. An average hitting percentage lies around the .200-.250 range, where above .300 is the goal to have an excellent hitting percentage. Holman ended at a hitting percentage of 0.358, ranking No.60 among players in the NCAA. This season for Nebraska, Jackson has a .401 hitting percentage, ranking at No.25. Everyone ahead of Jackson is sophomores, juniors, or seniors. Jackson is the first freshman you see leading in hitting percentage, but some others come ranked later on behind her. If Jackson is already swinging her way ahead of the rest in hitting percentage now as a freshman, and showing higher numbers than a senior AVCA All-America player, how good is she going to be when she’s a senior?\n\n\nCode\nwinsloss2017 &lt;- read_csv(\"winsloss2017.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2017)\n\nwinsloss2018 &lt;- read_csv(\"winsloss2018.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2018)\n\nwinsloss2019 &lt;- read_csv(\"winsloss2019.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2019)\n\nwinsloss2020 &lt;- read_csv(\"winsloss2020.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2020)\n\nwinsloss2021 &lt;- read_csv(\"winsloss2021.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2021)\n\nwinsloss2022 &lt;- read_csv(\"winsloss2022.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2022)\n\nwinsloss2023 &lt;- read_csv(\"winsloss2023.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2023)\n\nnu2017 &lt;- winsloss2017 |&gt;\n  filter (Team == \"Nebraska (Big Ten)\")\n\nwinsloss &lt;- bind_rows(winsloss2017, winsloss2018, winsloss2019, winsloss2020, winsloss2021, winsloss2022, winsloss2023) |&gt;\nfilter(Rank &lt;= 25) \n\nnuwinsloss &lt;- winsloss |&gt; filter(Team == \"Nebraska (Big Ten)\")\n\nkentuckywinsloss &lt;- winsloss |&gt; filter(Team == \"Kentucky (SEC)\")\n\ntexaswinsloss &lt;- winsloss |&gt; filter(Team == \"Texas (Big 12)\")\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_line(data=winsloss, aes(x=Season, y=`Pct.`, group=Team), color=\"light grey\") +\n  geom_line(data=nuwinsloss, aes(x=Season, y=`Pct.`, group=Team), color=\"red\") +\n  geom_point(data=nuwinsloss, aes(x=Season, y=`Pct.`, group=Team), color=\"red\") +\n  geom_line(data=kentuckywinsloss, aes(x=Season, y=`Pct.`, group=Team), color=\"#0033A0\") +\ngeom_line(data=texaswinsloss, aes(x=Season, y=`Pct.`, group=Team), color=\"#BF5700\") +\nlabs(x=\"Season\", y=\"Win Pct.\", title=\"Nebraska's on top, but hasn't always been\", subtitle=\"Nebraska, Kentucky and Texas are some of the several national championship winners in the last few years. \nBut, Nebraska's looking hot this season, and is doing better as of now against championship winning teams. \",  caption=\"Source: NCAA | By Faith Worden\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n  plot.title = element_text(size = 12, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=8.5), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n)\n\n\n\n\n\nLastly, this line chart shows the win percentage from the 2017 season until now, which also highlights some competitors who have also been national championship winners in the past few years as well. That highlights Kentucky and Texas. The Longhorns won the championship last season, and the last time Kentucky won was in 2020. The Huskers this season are on top of everyone, but that wasn’t how it always was. The 2017 Husker national championship-winning team choked against teams like Wisconsin, Florida and Oregon. Their first loss was in the beginning of October, giving them a win streak of 19 games before they lost to the Badgers. This year, the Huskers took a win against Wisconsin, giving them their first win against them in 10 matches. Nebraska has yet to lose this season, they are 24-0.\nIf Nebraska is competing at similar levels, if not higher than the last championship-winning team, could Nebraska pull through and win the championship this year? Also, comparing 2017 seniors to freshmen now, how good are these freshmen such as Reilly and Jackson going to be when they are putting up the same levels now as championship-winning, decorated former players. Overall, Nebraska is keeping at the same pace as national championship winners and are putting up impressive numbers. Now, can they get to the championship this season?"

    "title": "Can Luka Dončić fill the shoes of Mavericks legend Dirk Nowitzki?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Dirk Nowitzki was just a kid from Germany who grew up playing basketball. Nowitzki made the move to the states in 1998, when he was chosen as the ninth pick by the Milwaukee Bucks. His career was spent with the Dallas Mavericks after an immediate trade. Nowitzki then played 21 seasons for this franchise, and is the only NBA player to have done this. Nowtizki is known to be one of the greatest players to have ever played for the Mavericks, and to have played in the NBA. With several accomplishments and records, such as leading Dallas to their first ever championship in 2011 and the Basketball Hall of Fame, he’s had a great impact. In Dirk’s last season played, he was joined by Slovenia-native Luka Dončić. Dončić, the third pick in the 2018 NBA draft, had high expectations. He was drafted by the Atlanta Hawks, but like Nowitzki, had an immediate trade over to Dallas. In his sixth season, Dončić has already proved himself as the team’s MVP. Averaging 27.8 points per game and helping lead the team to the final four 2022, he has shown a lot of leadership and pulled out crazy stats for the team. A topic of conversation within NBA fans: can Dončić be the next Nowitzki for the team? Where is he at compared to Nowitzki’s performance? Both foreign players who entered the NBA with no college experience, a lot of people will put them head to head. Let’s dive into the question, is Dončić the new Nowitzki?\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(waffle)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(patchwork)\n\nrookieluka &lt;- read_csv(\"1819nba.csv\") |&gt;\nfilter(Player == \"Luka Dončić\")\n\nrookiedirk &lt;- read_csv(\"9899nba.csv\") |&gt;\n  filter(Player == \"Dirk Nowitzki*\")\n\nlukafirstseason &lt;- read_csv(\"1819nba.csv\")\n\n\ndirkfirstseason &lt;- read_csv(\"9899nba.csv\")\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_point(data=dirkfirstseason, aes(x=FG, y=FGA), color=\"darkgrey\") +\n geom_point(data=lukafirstseason, aes(x=FG, y=FGA), color=\"lightgrey\") +\n  geom_point(data=rookiedirk, aes(x=FG, y=FGA), color=\"#002B5E\") +\n  geom_point(data=rookieluka, aes(x=FG, y=FGA), color=\"#002B5E\") +\n   geom_text(data=rookiedirk, aes(x=FG-.09, y=FGA-1, label=Player)) + \n  geom_text(data=rookieluka, aes(x=FG-.9, y=FGA-1, label=Player)) +\nlabs(x=\"Field Goals\", y=\"Field Goal Attempts\", title=\" Luka coming out strong as a rookie\", subtitle=\"Dončić put up more shots, and made them successfully in\nhis first season with the Mavericks.\",  caption=\"Source: Sports Reference | By Faith Worden\") +\n  theme_minimal () +\n  theme(\n  plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=12), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n)\n\n\n\n\n\nComparing both their rookie seasons, Luka was putting up way more shots than Dirk, and making them successfully.

How are Dončić and Nowtizki doing defensively? It’s important to have a strong rebounder because it gives your team a good defense, limits the offense of the other team, and gives your team possession of the ball and opportunity to score. Though Nowitzki may be known for a strong offense and his one-leg fadeaway shot, he’s contributed defensively and has been able to take possession of the ball. Nowitzki’s defensive rebounding declined overtime. Dončić’s has slightly as well, but has remained more consistent.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(waffle)\nlibrary(ggalt)\n\n\nluka &lt;- c(\"2P\"=2284, \"3P\"=978, 7907)\ndirk &lt;- c(\"2P\"=9187, \"3P\"=1982)\n\niron(\nwaffle(luka/100,\n        rows = 5,\n        title=\"Luka's Career Points\",\n       xlab= \"Luka Dončić | 1 square = 100 shots\",\n        colors = c(\"#002B5E\", \"#B8C4CA\", \"#FFFFFF\")) +\n     labs(\n     title=\"The difference 21 seasons makes\", \n     subtitle=\"Luka's putting up great numbers, but don't give him \nall the credit yet.\") +\n   theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10),\n    axis.title.y = element_blank(),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=12), \n  ),\nwaffle(dirk/100,\n        rows = 5,\n        xlab= \"Dirk Nowitzki | 1 square = 100 shots\", \n        colors = c(\"#002B5E\", \"#B8C4CA\")) +\n       labs(\n         caption=\"Source: Sports Reference | By Faith Worden\")\n)\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s take a look into both of the Mavericks’ stars’ career statistics. Both players are putting up more two-pointer’s than three’s. Dončić hasn’t even gotten to half of Nowitzki’s two points and three point shots in his career total, but he’s at a decent spot. It’s going to take years to get to a level that someone once was at 21 seasons, but Dončić is crawling up close.\nAfter all, Dončić has been compared to Nowitzki his whole career. Is Dončić going to pull a Nowitzki and stay loyal to Dallas his whole career? Will Luka beat this and that record and surpass Dirk in different stats? What will it take for Dončić to pass Nowitzki as the best, most successful player to come from the Mavericks’ franchise?
