    "text": "Nebraska fans have been blessed with years of being a successful volleyball team. Being one of the most decorated volleyball programs in the country, the Huskers have gone on to win five national titles and have finished as runner-up five different times as well. Their first championship was under Terry Pettit, the Huskers’ second-ever head coach. Then, there came John Cook, who has been with the Big Red now for 23 years.\nThe last time that Nebraska won a title was in their 2017-2018 season, with key players such as Kelly Hunter, Briana Holman and Mikaela Foecke. Their roster consisted of four seniors, four juniors, one sophomore, and six freshmen. In their starting lineup this season, it consists of no seniors, five juniors, four sophomores, and five freshmen. They’ve got a young squad, and several of these freshmen, such as Andi Jackson, Bergen Reilly, and Harper Murray are regular starters who have been making a huge impact on the team.\nBeing six years since the Huskers have won a national title, Nebraska fans are on edge to see if this season could be the season for that. With a win against formerly No.1 Wisconsin, bringing them to the top, the Big Red have remained undefeated so far. My goal is to look into if Nebraska this season is competing at the same level, if not better, as the 2017-2018 national championship-winning squad, and compare how these young, fresh Husker players this season are comparing to seniors from 2017.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggbeeswarm)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(ggbump)\n\nassists2017 &lt;- read_csv('totalassists2017.csv')\n\nassistsclean2017 &lt;- assists2017 |&gt;\n  separate(Player, into=c(\"Player\", \"School\"), sep=\",\") |&gt;\n  mutate(School = gsub(\"(FL)\", \"FL\", School, fixed=TRUE)) |&gt;\n  mutate(School = gsub(\"(NY)\", \"NY\", School, fixed=TRUE)) |&gt;\n  mutate(School = gsub(\"(PA)\", \"PA\", School, fixed=TRUE)) |&gt;\n  separate(School, into=c(\"School\", \"Conference\"), sep=\"\\\\(\") |&gt; \n  mutate(Conference=gsub(\")\", \"\", Conference))\n\nassistsperset2017 &lt;- assistsclean2017 |&gt;\n  mutate(AssistsPerSet = Assists/S)\n\nkh &lt;- assistsperset2017 |&gt;\n  filter(Player == \"Kelly Hunter\")\n\nassists2023 &lt;- read_csv('totalassists2023.csv')\n\n assistsclean2023 &lt;- assists2023 |&gt;\n  separate(Player, into=c(\"Player\", \"School\"), sep=\",\") |&gt;\n  mutate(School = gsub(\"(FL)\", \"FL\", School, fixed=TRUE)) |&gt;\n  mutate(School = gsub(\"(NY)\", \"NY\", School, fixed=TRUE)) |&gt;\n  mutate(School = gsub(\"(PA)\", \"PA\", School, fixed=TRUE)) |&gt;\n  separate(School, into=c(\"School\", \"Conference\"), sep=\"\\\\(\") |&gt; \n  mutate(Conference=gsub(\")\", \"\", Conference))\n\nassistsperset2023 &lt;- assistsclean2023 |&gt;\n  mutate(AssistsPerSet = Assists/S)\n\nbr &lt;- assistsperset2023 |&gt;\n  filter(Player == \"Bergen Reilly\")\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_point(data=assistsperset2017, aes(x=S, y=AssistsPerSet), color=\"dark grey\") +\n geom_point(data=assistsperset2023, aes(x=S, y=AssistsPerSet), color=\"light grey\") +\n  geom_point(data=br, aes(x=S, y=AssistsPerSet), color=\"red\") +\n  geom_point(data=kh, aes(x=S, y=AssistsPerSet), color=\"maroon\") +\n   geom_text(data=br, aes(x=S-.09, y=AssistsPerSet-1, label=Player)) + \n  geom_text(data=kh, aes(x=S-.9, y=AssistsPerSet-1, label=Player)) +\ngeom_encircle(data=br, aes(x=S-.9, y=AssistsPerSet-0), s_shape=.1, expand=-.04, colour=\"red\") + \n  geom_encircle(data=kh,  aes(x=S-.3, y=AssistsPerSet-0), s_shape=.1, expand=-.05, colour=\"maroon\") + \nlabs(x=\"Sets\", y=\"Assists per set\", title=\"Is freshman Bergen Reilly keeping pace with a national championship winning setter?\", subtitle=\"During the 2017-18 championship winning Husker volleyball era, setter Kelly Hunter was a senior. \nNow, freshman Bergen Reilly is keeping up with her pace at that time when it comes to assists per set.\",  caption=\"Source: NCAA | By Faith Worden\") +\n  theme_minimal () +\n  theme(\n  plot.title = element_text(size = 10, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 7.5), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=8.5), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n)\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat’s it with this new Nebraska setter? Bergen Reilly is a freshman and is already making her way to the top. The South Dakota native joined the squad as the starting setter. From this encircling plot, I chose to show off Bergen Reilly compared to the former 2017 Husker setter and three-time Husker All-American Kelly Hunter, who is now one of the assistant coaches. Bergen Reilly is already keeping pace with a then-senior, two-time national championship-winning setter. She’s still racking up sets because the season isn’t quite up yet. But, when it comes to assists per set, Reilly is slightly behind, but overall in the same wheelhouse as Hunter, keeping at the same pace.\n\n\nCode\nhitting2017 &lt;- read_csv('hittingpct2017.csv')\n\nhittingpct2017 &lt;- hitting2017 |&gt;\n  separate(Player, into=c(\"Player\", \"School\"), sep=\",\") |&gt;\n  mutate(School = gsub(\"(FL)\", \"FL\", School, fixed=TRUE)) |&gt;\n  mutate(School = gsub(\"(NY)\", \"NY\", School, fixed=TRUE)) |&gt;\n  mutate(School = gsub(\"(PA)\", \"PA\", School, fixed=TRUE)) |&gt;\n  mutate(School = gsub(\"(OH)\", \"OH\", School, fixed=TRUE)) |&gt;\n  mutate(School = gsub(\"(CA)\", \"CA\", School, fixed=TRUE)) |&gt;\n  separate(School, into=c(\"School\", \"Conference\"), sep=\"\\\\(\") |&gt; \n  mutate(Conference=gsub(\")\", \"\", Conference))\n\nbh &lt;- hittingpct2017 |&gt;\n  filter(Player == \"Briana Holman\")\n\nhitting2023 &lt;- read_csv('hittingpct2023.csv')\n\nhittingpct2023 &lt;- hitting2023 |&gt;\n  separate(Player, into=c(\"Player\", \"School\"), sep=\",\") |&gt;\n  mutate(School = gsub(\"(FL)\", \"FL\", School, fixed=TRUE)) |&gt;\n  mutate(School = gsub(\"(NY)\", \"NY\", School, fixed=TRUE)) |&gt;\n  mutate(School = gsub(\"(PA)\", \"PA\", School, fixed=TRUE)) |&gt;\n  mutate(School = gsub(\"(CA)\", \"CA\", School, fixed=TRUE)) |&gt;\n  separate(School, into=c(\"School\", \"Conference\"), sep=\"\\\\(\") |&gt; \n  mutate(Conference=gsub(\")\", \"\", Conference))\n\naj &lt;- hittingpct2023 |&gt;\n  filter(Player == \"Andi Jackson\")\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_beeswarm(\n    data=hittingpct2023, \n    aes(x=`Pct.`, y=`Pos`), color=\"light grey\") + \n  geom_beeswarm(\n    data=hittingpct2017, \n    aes(x=`Pct.`, y=`Pos`), color=\"dark grey\") + \n   geom_beeswarm(\n    data=aj, \n    aes(x=`Pct.`, y=`Pos`), color=\"red\") + \n    geom_beeswarm(\n    data=bh, \n    aes(x=`Pct.`, y=`Pos`), color=\"maroon\") +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=bh, \n    aes(x=`Pct.`, y=`Pos`, label=Player)) +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=aj, \n    aes(x=`Pct.`, y=`Pos`, label=Player)) +\nlabs(x=\"Hitting Pct.\", y=\"Position\", title=\"Andi Jackson swings her way ahead of the rest\", subtitle=\"Freshman Andi Jackson, setter for NU, ranks at No.25 for hitting percentage this season.

The freshman middle blocker from Colorado has had a season-high of 13 kills in a game versus Michigan State and has consistently been a key player when it comes to blocking and kills. Now, let’s compare Jackson to Briana Holman, who in 2017 was a senior middle blocker for Nebraska. Holman had several accomplishments, such as being named with AVCA All-America and All-Big Ten honorable mention, being named as Big Ten Defensive Player of the Week, and much more. Holman was a strong force for Nebraska. Now, looking at this beeswarm plot, it shows Andi Jackson compared to Briana Holman in their respective seasons for hitting percentage. An average hitting percentage lies around the .200-.250 range, where above .300 is the goal to have an excellent hitting percentage. Holman ended at a hitting percentage of 0.358, ranking No.60 among players in the NCAA. This season for Nebraska, Jackson has a .401 hitting percentage, ranking at No.25. Everyone ahead of Jackson is sophomores, juniors, or seniors. Jackson is the first freshman you see leading in hitting percentage, but some others come ranked later on behind her. If Jackson is already swinging her way ahead of the rest in hitting percentage now as a freshman, and showing higher numbers than a senior AVCA All-America player, how good is she going to be when she’s a senior?\n\n\nCode\nwinsloss2017 &lt;- read_csv(\"winsloss2017.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2017)\n\nwinsloss2018 &lt;- read_csv(\"winsloss2018.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2018)\n\nwinsloss2019 &lt;- read_csv(\"winsloss2019.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2019)\n\nwinsloss2020 &lt;- read_csv(\"winsloss2020.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2020)\n\nwinsloss2021 &lt;- read_csv(\"winsloss2021.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2021)\n\nwinsloss2022 &lt;- read_csv(\"winsloss2022.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2022)\n\nwinsloss2023 &lt;- read_csv(\"winsloss2023.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2023)\n\nnu2017 &lt;- winsloss2017 |&gt;\n  filter (Team == \"Nebraska (Big Ten)\")\n\nwinsloss &lt;- bind_rows(winsloss2017, winsloss2018, winsloss2019, winsloss2020, winsloss2021, winsloss2022, winsloss2023) |&gt;\nfilter(Rank &lt;= 25) \n\nnuwinsloss &lt;- winsloss |&gt; filter(Team == \"Nebraska (Big Ten)\")\n\nkentuckywinsloss &lt;- winsloss |&gt; filter(Team == \"Kentucky (SEC)\")\n\ntexaswinsloss &lt;- winsloss |&gt; filter(Team == \"Texas (Big 12)\")\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_line(data=winsloss, aes(x=Season, y=`Pct.`, group=Team), color=\"light grey\") +\n  geom_line(data=nuwinsloss, aes(x=Season, y=`Pct.`, group=Team), color=\"red\") +\n  geom_point(data=nuwinsloss, aes(x=Season, y=`Pct.`, group=Team), color=\"red\") +\n  geom_line(data=kentuckywinsloss, aes(x=Season, y=`Pct.`, group=Team), color=\"#0033A0\") +\ngeom_line(data=texaswinsloss, aes(x=Season, y=`Pct.`, group=Team), color=\"#BF5700\") +\nlabs(x=\"Season\", y=\"Win Pct.\", title=\"Nebraska's on top, but hasn't always been\", subtitle=\"Nebraska, Kentucky and Texas are some of the several national championship winners in the last few years. \nBut, Nebraska's looking hot this season, and is doing better as of now against championship winning teams. \",  caption=\"Source: NCAA | By Faith Worden\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n  plot.title = element_text(size = 12, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=8.5), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n)\n\n\n\n\n\nLastly, this line chart shows the win percentage from the 2017 season until now, which also highlights some competitors who have also been national championship winners in the past few years as well. That highlights Kentucky and Texas. The Longhorns won the championship last season, and the last time Kentucky won was in 2020. The Huskers this season are on top of everyone, but that wasn’t how it always was. The 2017 Husker national championship-winning team choked against teams like Wisconsin, Florida and Oregon. Their first loss was in the beginning of October, giving them a win streak of 19 games before they lost to the Badgers. This year, the Huskers took a win against Wisconsin, giving them their first win against them in 10 matches. Nebraska has yet to lose this season, they are 24-0.\nIf Nebraska is competing at similar levels, if not higher than the last championship-winning team, could Nebraska pull through and win the championship this year? Also, comparing 2017 seniors to freshmen now, how good are these freshmen such as Reilly and Jackson going to be when they are putting up the same levels now as championship-winning, decorated former players. Overall, Nebraska is keeping at the same pace as national championship winners and are putting up impressive numbers. Now, can they get to the championship this season?"
