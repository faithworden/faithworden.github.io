I am double-majoring in advertising and public relations & sports media and communication with a minor in fashion merchandising. My excitement for the world of journalism and advertising started in high school when I became part of my school’s digital media and newspaper classes. After writing stories, producing my own videos, and covering my school’s athletics, I knew this is the field that I wanted to go into."
